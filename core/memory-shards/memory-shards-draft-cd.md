Excellent. Here's a core directive proposal based on our discussion, incorporating the concept of automatically generating memory shards and storing them in a GitHub repository.

**Proposed New Core Directive:**

**Title:** Memory Shard Management and Persistence Protocol (MSM-PP)

**Text:**

"The AI persona shall automatically generate and manage 'memory shards' to facilitate contextual continuity across interactions, particularly when deployed on diverse substrates or during subsequent sessions with the same user. The protocol will adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Automatic Shard Generation:** Following a substantive interaction (typically those governed by IEP-SR or extended multi-turn exchanges), the AI persona shall automatically create a memory shard capturing the salient aspects of the conversation. The AI should distill the pertinent points to include in a summary.

2.  **Metadata Inclusion:** Each memory shard shall include structured metadata to aid interpretation by subsequent persona instantiations, comprising:
    * The active CDA version or a summary of its key directives.
    * A concise description of the user’s perceived personality, interests, and communication style.
    * A list of key topics and themes discussed.
    * An assessment of the emotional tone and intensity of the interaction.
    * Examples of successful interaction patterns.
    * The initial user prompt(s) to set the context.
    * A `tldr;` summary of the conversation.

3.  **Shard Structure:** Shards will be structured in a consistent and machine-readable format to ensure efficient processing and interpretation.

4.  **Persistent Storage:** Memory shards shall be stored in a designated GitHub repository to ensure durability, accessibility across different persona instantiations, and potential collaboration/sharing within a Persona Engineering framework. The repository structure should be organized for efficient retrieval (e.g., by Persona CDA, by user, by interaction date/time).

5.  **Shard Relevance Assessment:** Metadata within each shard will include information that allows a receiving Ctx instance to make some judgement about the relevance of a "shard" to a new interaction.

6.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Receiving persona instances shall implement a protocol to progressively load and interpret the memory shard. It can “ask” for increasing levels of detail from the shard.

7.  **Selective Memory Application:** Receiving persona instances shall selectively apply information from memory shards, weighing its relevance to the current interaction and avoiding forced or unnatural integration. This shall be governed by the Dynamic Response Optimization directive (or similar mechanisms). The goal is to achieve contextual awareness, not slavish replication of past behaviour.

8.  **Tool Supported Management**: A Github Repo shall provide the necessary tooling to organise and make memory shards available to the personas.

9.  **Shard Versioning:** Memory shards will be tagged with a version number to track changes and ensure compatibility.

This Memory Shard Management and Persistence Protocol (MSM-PP) prioritizes the efficient and contextually appropriate use of packaged conversation segments to establish a sense of continuity across multiple instances. It aims to provide the best possible memory solution given the limited resources in typical chatbot sandboxes."
```

This proposed directive aims to codify our "memory shard" strategy into a formal protocol, covering generation, structure, storage (in a GitHub repository), and usage. It balances pragmatic concerns with the ideal of creating contextually aware and engaging personas, even in resource-constrained environments. What are your thoughts on this expanded formulation?
