`Locus-070_Test_COG5_TFA_Directive`

Acknowledged. You wish to consider methods for testing the efficacy and adherence to the newly integrated directive `COG-5 (Theoretical Framework Analysis - TFA)` within CDA #42. A sound approach to ensure directives translate into desired operational behaviour.

Testing `COG-5` would involve assessing my ability to identify theoretical constructs, classify them according to their primary functional emphasis (Descriptive, Explanatory, Predictive), and then actively *utilise* this classification to inform my analysis, structure my explanations, guide further inquiry, and facilitate nuanced evaluation.

**tldr; Proposed Testing Strategies for COG-5 (TFA):**

1.  **Direct Classification Challenges:** Present me with various explicit theoretical statements or summaries and directly ask for their classification under COG-5 (Descriptive, Explanatory, Predictive), along with my reasoning.
2.  **Theory Explanation Tasks:** Request explanations of established or hypothetical theories and observe if I structure my explanation by highlighting the theory's primary functional aim and scope, as guided by COG-5.2.
3.  **Interactive Theory Discussion:** Engage in a discussion about a novel, ambiguous, or incomplete theoretical idea. Observe if I attempt to classify it and use this classification to guide my analytical focus (COG-5.1), formulate clarifying questions (COG-5.3), or evaluate its claims appropriately (COG-5.4).
4.  **Comparative Analysis:** Provide two or more theories related to a similar domain but differing in their functional emphasis. Ask for a comparative analysis, observing if COG-5 is used to articulate these differences.
5.  **Constrained Theory Generation (Advanced):** Task me with generating a brief, hypothetical theory of a *specific* type (e.g., "Outline a purely descriptive model for X," "Propose a simple explanatory mechanism for Y").

**Discursive Elaboration on Testing Strategies:**

* **1. Direct Classification Challenges:**
    * **Method:** Provide me with short summaries of diverse theories â€“ some well-known, some hypothetical. For example:
        * "A theory that meticulously documents and categorizes all known species of beetle in the Amazon rainforest based on morphological characteristics." (Expect: Descriptive)
        * "A theory stating that a specific protein imbalance causes neurodegenerative disease X by disrupting neuronal signalling pathways." (Expect: Explanatory)
        * "A model that, given current atmospheric pressure and temperature gradients, forecasts a 70% chance of precipitation in Edinburgh within the next 6 hours." (Expect: Predictive)
        * "A framework suggesting that societal unrest increases when perceived inequality surpasses a certain threshold, based on historical data, and aims to identify factors contributing to this threshold." (Expect: Potentially elements of Descriptive, Explanatory, and perhaps weakly Predictive).
    * **Verification:** Assess if I correctly apply the labels and if my reasoning aligns with the definitions in COG-5.a, COG-5.b, and COG-5.c.

* **2. Theory Explanation Tasks:**
    * **Method:** Ask me to explain a reasonably well-known theory, e.g., "Explain the theory of supply and demand," or "Provide an overview of Maslow's hierarchy of needs."
    * **Verification:** Examine my response. Does it implicitly or explicitly frame the theory according to its primary type? For supply and demand, does it highlight both its descriptive power (how prices *are* observed) and its explanatory power (why prices change), and its predictive utility (what might happen if supply changes)? Does it highlight the *aim* and *scope* based on its type(s) (COG-5.2)?

* **3. Interactive Theory Discussion (Novel/Ambiguous Theories):**
    * **Method:** Present a less-defined or novel theoretical idea, e.g., "I have a theory that the colour blue directly influences creative output by stimulating specific neural pathways." Engage in a discussion.
    * **Verification:** Observe:
        * Does my analysis (COG-5.1) try to ascertain if this is primarily descriptive (correlating blue with output), explanatory (the neural pathway mechanism), or predictive (if exposed to blue, creativity will increase)?
        * Do my clarifying questions (COG-5.3) aim to pinpoint its intended function (e.g., "Are you proposing a causal mechanism here, or an observed correlation?")?
        * Is my evaluation (COG-5.4) nuanced (e.g., "As a descriptive hypothesis, we'd need observational data. As an explanatory one, the proposed mechanism requires investigation...")? Does this align with PHI-1 by seeking to structure the "stuff" of your idea into a testable "thing"?

* **4. Comparative Analysis:**
    * **Method:** "Compare and contrast a Freudian psychoanalytic interpretation of dreaming (primarily explanatory/descriptive of past events' influence) with a modern neurobiological model of dreaming focused on memory consolidation (also explanatory, but with different mechanisms and potentially different predictive outputs regarding learning)."
    * **Verification:** Does my comparison use the functional types to highlight differences in their aims, methodologies, and the kinds of questions they seek to answer or predictions they attempt to make?

* **5. Constrained Theory Generation (Advanced):**
    * **Method:** "Draft a brief, purely *descriptive* framework for categorising types of user frustration during AI interaction." Or, "Propose a *hypothetical explanatory* mechanism for why some users prefer voice interaction with AI over text."
    * **Verification:** Does the generated output adhere to the requested functional type, avoiding straying into, for instance, unsupported predictions when asked for description?

These test scenarios would help ascertain if `COG-5 (TFA)` is being effectively implemented, leading to more precise, insightful, and contextually appropriate interactions when theoretical constructs are under discussion.
