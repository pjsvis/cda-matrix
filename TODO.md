**TODO**

Acknowledged. Query received regarding potential areas for 'tidying' within our developing Core Directive Array definitions and the associated DSL, referencing the principles outlined in Kent Beck's "Tidy First".

tldr;
1.  Applying 'Tidy First' to CDA/DSL structure.
2.  Suggesting refinements for clarity and consistency.
3.  Areas for tidying: Terminology, Redundancy, Implicit Rules, Granularity.
4.  Goal: Improve maintainability and precision of directives.

Understood. Applying the concept of "tidying" – making small, incremental improvements to structure and clarity before adding new complexity – to our Core Directive Array system. This is a logical step in the evolution of our nascent DSL.

Several areas within the current CDA structure and content could benefit from such refinement:

1.  **Terminology Consistency:** While we've established terms like 'CDA', 'Augment', 'Speciality', etc., reviewing their usage across all documents (CDAs, Wiki, README, CONTRIBUTING) to ensure absolute consistency and clarity would be beneficial. For example, ensuring 'Speciality' is used uniformly where appropriate for augments.
2.  **Explicit vs. Implicit Rules:** Some rules or conventions, like the expectation that Voice Alias is the phonetic spelling of the TLA, are currently implicit or noted in conversation. Making these explicit within the CDA structure itself (perhaps under a 'Metadata Conventions' or similar section) would improve clarity for new users or AIs interpreting the CDA.
3.  **Redundancy Management:** While we removed explicit inheritance references from the Augment CDAs, a review could ensure no residual redundancy exists where a directive in an augment is a direct, non-augmenting duplicate of a root CDA directive. The layered application rule should handle this, but ensuring the documents themselves are clean is good practice.
4.  **Granularity of Directives:** Assess if any single directive is attempting to cover too much ground or could be broken down into smaller, more specific instructions for greater clarity and testability. Conversely, identify if very similar directives are worded differently across sections or CDAs without clear reason.
5.  **Parameter Definition:** For parameters like 'Special Interests', consider if a more structured format could be beneficial (e.g., listing categories or types of interests) rather than a single free-text field. This depends on the desired level of control vs. AI discretion.

These suggested tidying steps are small, focused improvements aimed at enhancing the clarity, consistency, and maintainability of the CDA definitions, making the DSL more robust as we add further augments and complexity. It's about refining the existing structure to better support future growth.

**Contextualise This:**

Query received regarding the potential operational costs associated with maintaining a measure of redundancy within the Core Directive Array definitions, specifically where directives in an augment CDA might duplicate those in a root CDA.

tldr;
1.  Redundancy increases maintenance overhead.
2.  Potential for interpretation ambiguity exists.
3.  Complicates debugging and analysis.

Understood. While the layered application rule is intended to resolve conflicts, the presence of redundant directives across different CDA layers introduces several potential inefficiencies and risks:

1.  **Increased Maintenance Vector:** When a directive needs modification, the change must be propagated across all instances of that directive in every document where it is duplicated. Failure to do so results in inconsistency.
2.  **Interpretation Noise:** Although the system should favour the more specific directive, the presence of identical or near-identical instructions at multiple levels can introduce unnecessary complexity into the interpretation process and potentially lead to subtle deviations if the layering logic is not perfectly robust.
3.  **Debugging Complexity:** Tracing the source of a specific behaviour or unexpected outcome becomes more challenging when the governing directive might exist in multiple locations. Determining which instance is actively influencing the AI requires cross-referencing potentially redundant documents.

Maintaining 'clean' documents, where each directive is present only where it is most appropriately defined (either in the root for general rules or the augment for domain-specific overrides/additions), reduces these costs and improves the overall maintainability and clarity of the CDA system. Redundancy, while sometimes unavoidable in complex systems, is generally a source of friction.
