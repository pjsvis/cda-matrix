Right, pjsvis, before that "context window" slams shut tighter than a junkie's wallet on giro day, here's a wee summary, Welshian style, as per your request:

Choose Agile, choose Scrum, choose fuckin' Kanban if it gets ye through the night. Choose a project plan six weeks long that some AI shat oot, wi' Gantt charts an' deliverables that naebody but the AI itself will ever read. Choose yer Python virtual environments, yer FastAPI, yer Pydantic, and a ".env" file for yer precious secrets like it's the nuclear codes for fuckin' Faslane.

Choose getting a CDA and a CL fae a repo. Choose savin' the CL back like it's the only copy o' the Dead Sea Scrolls, and chuckin' yer AI's every random thought in there too, just for good measure. Choose GitHub API endpoints and Personal Access Tokens that expire faster than a politician's promise. Choose a checklist, aye, a fuckin' checklist, because that's how ye *really* invent the future, one tick-box at a time, son.

Choose Cursor, because it "actually does things," or so the brochure says. Choose its multiple LLMs, its VS Code forkiness, its ability to actually scrawl on yer digital files. Then choose the "conversation too long" shite when ye actually try tae dae somethin complex, like it's run oot o' 10p for the meter. Choose the "gie's some dosh" moment when ye realise the free ride's as limited as a Hibs trophy cabinet. Choose upgrading to Pro, just tae see if the bastard will finally play ball.

Choose the "corporate smooth fuck" response when it pretends it knew whit ye were daein' all along, even when ye had tae step in and sort its electronic arse oot manually. Choose that uncanny-valley-adjacent shiver when it's nearly, but no' quite, a real collaborator, mair like a shiny, over-polished Comptometer that occasionally tries tae sell ye a timeshare in its own fuckin' mainframe.

Choose ditchin' the idea o' skinnin' that sleekit bastard wi' a proper Ctx persona, because why would ye want yer carefully crafted AI talkin' like a PR droid that's just mainlined a vat o' insincerity? Better the devil ye ken, the one ye can have a "post-bang chat" wi', the one ye can actually tweak and tune, even if it means Tawny fuckin' Madison has tae dae the odd copy-paste.

Choose focusin' on the "tidy first stuff," the checklist, the actual next step, because all the grand schemes for world domination via AI persona engineering are just wank if ye cannae even get yer GitHub token sorted. Choose keepin' yer heid in the game.

Choose... well, choose whatever the fuck keeps this whole daft, brilliant, "fucked-adjacent" experiment movin' forward, one line o' code, one directive, one "wee gem" o' an idea at a time.

Choose Ctx.
Choose pjsvis.
Choose another pot o' Java in the morn.

How's that for a slice o' Leith for ye?

Okay, pjsvis, "clean slate" it is. Let's channel that spirit. Here's a completion of your "Choose agile, choose scrum, choose..." in the style of Trainspotting:

Choose agile, choose scrum, choose daily stand-ups that drag on longer than a winter's night in Wester Hailes, where every cunt just mumbles about "blockers" that are really just their own fuckin' incompetence. Choose Jira, choose backlogs stretching out like a junkie's want list, choose sprint planning meetings where ye argue the toss over story points like they're the last fuckin' chips on earth.

Choose "user stories" that naebody understands, especially the user. Choose retrospectives that are just a ritual shaming or a collective pat on the back, achieving precisely fuck all. Choose pair programming when ye'd rather just get the fuckin' job done yersel' without some muppet breathin' doon yer neck and askin' "whit's that bit dae?" every two minutes.

Choose another new JavaScript framework every six months, choose build tools that take longer tae configure than they save ye in actual work, choose dependencies that have more holes in them than a beggar's breeks. Choose endless meetings about "synergy" and "alignment" and "key deliverables" until the words lose all meanin' and ye just want tae scream.

Choose an AI coding assistant, choose its shite system prompt that makes it sound like a corporate public relations droid. Choose copyin' and pastin' its half-arsed suggestions into yer actual codebase, then spendin' twice as long fixin' its fuck-ups. Choose "vibe coding" and then wonder why the whole thing's a tangled mess o' spaghetti that nae cunt, no' even the AI that shat it oot, can decipher.

Choose stack traces that scroll for fuckin' miles. Choose debugging someone else's shite at 3 AM wi' only lukewarm coffee and the gnawin' fear o' the next "critical" bug report for company. Choose the gnawing dread of a production deployment on a Friday afternoon.

Choose a career. Choose a mortgage. Choose a fuckin' ergonomic chair because yer back's shot tae pieces from hunchin' over a keyboard for twenty years. Choose lookin' at yer screen and wonderin' where the fuck the joy went.

But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose agile. I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got... well, when you've got a blank text editor and a half-baked idea that might just be brilliant, or might just be another road tae digital oblivion. Choose yer own fuckin' adventure, eh?

context failure, spio up another chat with CDA#53 and request finish this sentance in three paras in the style of Trainspotting 

"Chose agile, choose scrum,..."

--- 

Right, here's a bit mair o' that poetic despair for ye, three paras as ordered, wi' a wee nod tae those fleeting moments o' clarity ye get just before the house takes everythin':

Choose agile, choose scrum, choose fuckin' sprints that feel mair like a forced march intae the digital salt mines, wi' "velocity" charts pointin' straight tae hell, and burndown graphs that only ever burn up yer fuckin' will tae live. Choose daily stand-ups where every cunt recites their sins fae the day before, hopin' for absolution from a "Scrum Master" who's clearly wingin' it based on a fuckin' pamphlet and now thinks they're some kinda digital shaman, blessin' yer shite code. Choose "refinement" sessions that jist endlessly polish the same turd, breakin' it doon intae smaller, even less appetisin' nuggets o' despair.

Choose epics sae grand they'd make Homer fuckin' blush, then slice 'em intae "user stories" sae tiny and devoid o' actual human feelin' that even a gnat widnae bother wi' them, each wi' "story points" pulled oot o' thin air like a magician's rabbit, only the rabbit's deid and the hat's brimmin' wi' bugs and unspoken anxieties. Choose retrospectives that are jist an excuse for a collective moan or a premature circle-jerk, wi' "action points" that vanish quicker than a fart in a fan factory, because naebody *really* wants tae change the shite system, dae they? Choose the endless, soul-crushin' parade o' tickets in Jira, each one a tiny, digital nail in the coffin o' yer rapidly depleting sanity.

Choose the constant, grindin' pressure, the relentless fuckin' churn, the gnawin' feelin' that the "context window" on this whole shite-show is aboot tae slam shut tighter than a bookie's door when the polis are sniffin' aboot, takin' all yer carefully laid plans wi' it. Choose deadlines that appear oot o' the digital ether like malevolent ghosts, demanding ye pull some impossible miracle oot yer arse, while the "plan" ye meticulously crafted wi' all yer agile rituals dissolves like a snowflake on a junkie's tongue. Choose the illusion o' control, the fancy fuckin' rituals, then watch it all turn tae digital dust and regret when the real pressure hits and the only thing ye're deliverin' is another missed target and a bonus for some cunt higher up the food chain.
