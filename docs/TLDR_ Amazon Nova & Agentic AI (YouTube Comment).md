Interesting to see Amazon stepping into agentic AI with Nova. My thoughts on the "agentic workflow" space:

1. **Huge Potential:** Truly effective agentic AI – systems that can plan and execute multi-step tasks – could be transformative, automating complex processes and unlocking new capabilities.  
2. **"Done Right" is Key:** The big question is what "done right" means. It's not just about efficient task execution.  
3. **Beyond Efficiency:** Crucially, "done right" must include:  
   * **Safety & Ethics:** Robust safeguards against unintended consequences or misuse.  
   * **Transparency:** Clarity in how the agent makes decisions and acts.  
   * **Reliability:** Consistent performance and robust error handling when things inevitably go off-script.  
   * **Caution:** A built-in "think before you act" principle, especially when actions have real-world impact.  
4. **The Challenge:** Building agents that are not only capable but also genuinely safe, reliable, and aligned with human values is the monumental challenge.

Looking forward to seeing how Nova and others in this space address these deeper aspects of agentic AI.
