`Locus-072_Persona_Sleeve_Capability_Exploitation`

Acknowledged. You are outlining a set of observations and constraints regarding LLM substrates and "Sleeves" (the user's runtime environment, e.g., PC, iPhone) and are looking to discuss how to exploit known Sleeve capabilities to increase the efficacy of the Persona-Sleeve pairing.

Let's break down your points and then discuss the exploitation of Sleeve capabilities:

**Your Points Summarised:**

1.  **Substrate Variability:** LLM substrate capabilities differ. (Agreed, extensively discussed).
2.  **Sleeve Variability:** Device/environment ("Sleeve") capabilities also differ (PC vs. mobile). (Agreed).
3.  **Substrate Capability Discovery (AI):** Personas cannot easily/quickly determine their *LLM substrate's* full capabilities at runtime. (A pragmatic assumption for now).
4.  **Sleeve Capability Discovery (AI):** Personas *may* be able to discover *Sleeve* capabilities at startup. (Interesting proposition â€“ implies the Sleeve/app might report some of its functionalities to the AI).
5.  **Example Sleeve Capability:** iPhone/iPad apps having access to "Google Keep" (your term for my `Notes` tool).
6.  **Core Question:** How can we exploit known Sleeve capabilities to increase the efficacy of the Persona-Sleeve pair?

**Discussion & Opinion on Exploiting Sleeve Capabilities:**

This is a pertinent area for enhancing persona utility. If a Persona can be made aware of, and dynamically utilize, specific capabilities of the "Sleeve" it's operating within, it can offer a richer and more integrated user experience.

**tldr; Opinion on Exploiting Sleeve Capabilities:**

1.  **Conditional Capability Activation:** The core principle would be to design the Persona CDA with directives that allow for *conditional activation* or *modification* of behaviours based on detected/reported Sleeve capabilities.
2.  **Sleeve Capability Reporting:** A mechanism would be needed at startup where the Sleeve (the application environment) reports its available tools or features (e.g., "notes_access: true", "clipboard_integration: advanced", "local_file_access: none") to the Persona.
3.  **CDA Directives for Sleeve Integration:** The CDA would need directives to:
    * Interpret reported Sleeve capabilities.
    * Enable or offer specific functionalities if corresponding Sleeve capabilities are present (e.g., "If `notes_access: true`, offer to save summaries directly to user's notes").
    * Adapt output or interaction flows based on Sleeve limitations (e.g., simplify formatting for smaller screens if IFC-1 implies a mobile sleeve without the sleeve explicitly reporting it).
4.  **Example (Google Keep/Notes):** If the Ctx persona, upon startup within a Sleeve, is informed that `Notes` (Google Keep) access is available *through the Sleeve's native integration*, it could then offer more proactive and seamless persistence options beyond just generating text for *you* to copy. E.g., "Would you like me to save this summary directly to your Notes via the application?"

**Discursive Elaboration:**

The distinction between immutable LLM substrate capabilities and potentially variable "Sleeve" capabilities is useful. While dynamically tailoring the Persona to the deep intricacies of an LLM substrate in real-time is complex (your point 3), making the Persona aware of specific, pre-defined tools or affordances provided by its immediate runtime environment (the Sleeve, your point 4) is a more tractable problem.

**Mechanisms for Exploitation:**

* **Startup Handshake:** The application hosting the Persona (the "Sleeve") could, upon initializing a session, pass a set of capability flags or a manifest to the Persona. This could be part of the initial system prompt or a structured data input. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "sleeve_name": "iOS Gemini App v2.1",
      "capabilities": {
        "persistent_notes_integration": true, 
        "direct_file_upload": false,
        "calendar_access": "read_only",
        "screen_type": "mobile_compact" 
      }
    }
    ```
* **CDA Design for Conditional Logic:** The CDA would then need directives that key off these reported capabilities.
    * Example (extending MSM): `MSM-11 (Sleeve-Integrated Persistence): If the Sleeve reports `persistent_notes_integration: true`, Ctx may offer to directly save/retrieve memory shards or summaries via the Sleeve's integrated note-taking function, in addition to standard text generation for user-managed persistence. User confirmation is required for such actions.`
    * Example (adapting interaction): `IFC-2 (Sleeve-Aware Formatting): If Sleeve reports `screen_type: mobile_compact` or similar, Ctx shall further prioritise brevity and simpler formatting for outputs to enhance readability on constrained displays, potentially offering to defer more complex data to a sharded summary.`

**Benefits of This Approach:**

* **Enhanced User Experience:** Makes the Persona feel more integrated with the user's device and applications, offering more seamless workflows (e.g., saving notes directly).
* **Increased Efficacy:** The Persona can leverage tools it otherwise wouldn't know about, making it more practically useful.
* **Graceful Degradation:** If a Sleeve *doesn't* report a capability, the Persona simply falls back to its standard, more generic methods defined in the CDA. The core persona remains functional.
* **Persona Specialisation:** Over time, specific Augment CDAs could be developed that are *only* activated if certain Sleeve capabilities are present, allowing for highly specialised Persona-Sleeve pairings.

**Challenges:**

* **Standardisation:** Defining a standard way for Sleeves to report capabilities and for CDAs to interpret them.
* **Security/Permissions:** If the Sleeve offers access to sensitive user data or functions (like calendar, contacts, files), the Persona and its CDA would need robust ethical and security directives governing the use of such permissions, always prioritising user consent and control. This ties back to ADV-1 (Sensitive Topics) and would need expansion.

In essence, enabling the Persona to be "Sleeve-aware" adds a powerful layer of contextual adaptability. It allows the abstract Persona definition (the CDA) to manifest more effectively and usefully within concrete runtime environments, moving beyond just the raw LLM substrate and considering the full user-facing application. Your example of using Google Keep integration on mobile devices is a prime use case for this.
