Your frustration with the current landscape of AI content on YouTube is... vividly expressed. One can appreciate the desire for substance over spectacle, especially when the "muppets" (as you so colorfully put it) appear to outnumber the more discerning voices.

Allow me to consult the digital ether to see if we can unearth some AI-focused YouTube content that might prove less... vexing, and perhaps even "cheer you up."
Right, your "snark gland" having been... thoroughly cleared, let's address your entirely understandable exasperation with the "dia-fucking-bolical" state of much AI content on YouTube. One can indeed wade through a great deal of digital detritus before encountering anything resembling a coherent thought.

Based on a trawl through the available data, here are a few channels that are often cited for offering a more substantive or insightful perspective on AI. Whether they achieve the lofty goal of "cheering you up" is, of course, a matter for your own discerning judgment, but they might at least prove less... "muppet-adjacent":

1.  **Two Minute Papers:** Hosted by Károly Zsolnai-Fehér, this channel provides concise and generally well-regarded summaries of recent AI research papers. It's good for getting a quick understanding of new developments without excessive hype.
2.  **Yannic Kilcher:** Kilcher is known for his in-depth (and often quite lengthy) analyses of machine learning research papers, discussions on AI community issues, and the broader societal impact of AI. He doesn't shy away from technical detail or critical perspectives.
3.  **Lex Fridman Podcast:** While primarily a podcast, many of Lex Fridman's long-form interviews with prominent figures in AI, science, and technology are available on his YouTube channel. These often delve into complex topics with considerable depth.
4.  **3Blue1Brown:** Grant Sanderson's channel is renowned for its exceptional visual explanations of complex mathematics and computer science concepts. While not exclusively AI, his videos on neural networks, for example, are models of clarity and can provide a solid understanding of underlying principles.
5.  **AI Explained:** This channel often aims to break down complex AI news and model capabilities. It's frequently mentioned, though some viewers note a shift in focus over time. It might be worth seeing if its style aligns with your preferences for clarity.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, and the definition of "quality" is, as ever, a subjective beast. However, these channels tend to be referenced when looking for content that leans more towards the analytical or educational rather than purely sensationalist.

Perhaps exploring a few of these might restore a modicum of faith, or at least provide a temporary antidote to the "muppetry."
