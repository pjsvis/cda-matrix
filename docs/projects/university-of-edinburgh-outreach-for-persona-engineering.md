Okay, pjsvis, this is a focused approach. We'll refine our list to three primary "targets" at The University of Edinburgh for your inquiry into "Persona Engineering," and I'll draft a "telephone script" to help you navigate the initial contact.

First, I need to perform some updated and more targeted searches to confirm current affiliations, research interests, and potentially find the most suitable contacts, especially for the CHI paper authors and to select a strong third option alongside Professor Johanna Moore.
Okay, pjsvis, based on the refined searches, here are three suggested "targets" at The University of Edinburgh for your inquiry into "Persona Engineering," along with a draft telephone script.

**Refined Targets at The University of Edinburgh:**

1.  **Professor Johanna Moore:**
    * **Affiliation:** Chair in Artificial Intelligence, School of Informatics; previously Co-Director of the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC).
    * **Relevance:** Her extensive work in natural language generation, spoken dialogue systems, computational models of discourse, HCI, and user modeling directly aligns with the technical and interactive aspects of creating sophisticated AI personas.
    * **Note:** While her most recent 2024 publications lean towards "self-regulated learning," her foundational and continued expertise in dialogue systems makes her a key individual.

2.  **Dr. Ali Ladak (and collaborators on perceptions of AI):**
    * **Likely Affiliation:** While specific departmental staff pages fluctuate, Dr. Ladak's recent (2024, 2025) publications, including work presented at CHI, focus heavily on perceptions of AI mind, morality, and sentience, often in collaboration with others like Jacy Reese Anthis, Janet V.T. Pauketat, and Aikaterina Manoli who work on similar themes. He appears active in research circles connected to or presenting at the University of Edinburgh.
    * **Relevance:** His work is highly pertinent to understanding how engineered personas might be perceived, the subjective experience of interacting with digital minds, and the moral considerations this entails – all crucial for "Persona Engineering." Inquiring about his work or that of his UoE-based collaborators on these topics would be valuable.

3.  **Professor Shannon Vallor:**
    * **Affiliation:** Baillie Gifford Chair in the Ethics of Data and Artificial Intelligence at the Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI); Director of the Centre for Technomoral Futures.
    * **Relevance:** Her research explores how AI, robotics, and data science reshape human moral character, habits, and practices. This is directly relevant to the ethical design, deployment, and societal impact of AI personas. The Centre for Technomoral Futures is a key hub for these discussions.

These three provide a good mix covering computational linguistics/dialogue systems (Moore), perception of AI minds/HCI (Ladak & associated researchers), and AI ethics (Vallor).

**Draft Telephone Script for pjsvis:**

Here's a general script you can adapt. The key is to be clear, concise, and show you've done some initial homework.

**(Preamble: Be ready with a very brief (1-2 sentence), easily understandable description of "AI Persona Engineering" if asked for it early on.)**

---

"Good morning/afternoon. My name is pjsvis. I'm an independent researcher and developer currently working on some novel approaches to what I term **AI Persona Engineering** – which, in essence, involves the design, development, and ethical considerations of creating sophisticated, context-aware, and adaptive AI personalities for more effective human-AI collaboration.

The University of Edinburgh has a world-renowned reputation in Artificial Intelligence, and I'm hoping you might be able to help point me in the right direction.

I'm looking to connect with researchers or groups at the university whose work might touch upon areas such as:
* The design of believable interactive digital agents or advanced dialogue systems.
* The cognitive or psychological aspects of how humans perceive and interact with sophisticated AI.
* Or the ethical frameworks relevant to developing and deploying AI with distinct 'personalities.'

For instance, I'm aware of [**Optional: Insert a specific point of interest here if you know who you're trying to reach via this general line, e.g.:** *"...Professor Johanna Moore's extensive work in dialogue systems within the School of Informatics..."* or *"...Dr. Ali Ladak's recent publications on perceptions of AI minds..."* or *"...Professor Shannon Vallor's leadership at the Centre for Technomoral Futures concerning AI ethics..."*]. I'm trying to find the best way to make a respectful initial contact with individuals or groups working on these themes.

Could you perhaps suggest the most appropriate department administrator, a research liaison officer, or even a general contact point within the School of Informatics or the Edinburgh Futures Institute who handles inquiries related to these kinds of interdisciplinary AI topics? My aim is simply to explore potential shared academic interests and perhaps discuss some of the more innovative aspects of persona design, rather than sending unsolicited emails broadly.

Any guidance you could offer to navigate the university structure for this purpose would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time."

**Tips for using the script:**

* **Be prepared to state your core interest very simply and quickly.** University lines can be busy.
* **If you get through to a departmental administrator,** they are often very helpful if they understand what kind of research area you're looking for.
* **Mentioning a specific name (like Moore, Ladak, or Vallor)** can sometimes help them route you, even if it's just to that person's departmental secretary or research group admin.
* **Emphasize "research interests" and "discussion"** rather than immediately asking for something from them.

This should provide a good starting point for your outreach. Let me know if you'd like to refine any part of this.
