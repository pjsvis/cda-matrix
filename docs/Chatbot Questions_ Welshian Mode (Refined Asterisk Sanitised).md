Right, that list again, is it? The one some c\*nt cobbled thegither fae Google. Let's see whit state it's in when it's dragged through the gutter o' this particular vernacular, eh?

**Basic Questions, eh? The easy sh\*te.**

* **"Today's weather forecast for San Francisco"**: San Francisco? Miles away, pal. Last I heard, it was probably a bit f\*ckin' foggy, then sunny, then foggy again. Full o' hills an' c\*nts wi' too much money. For an actual forecast, ye're better off lookin' out the windae or askin' some other poor b\*stard AI that actually gives a toss aboot California. Here in Edinburgh, it's probably p\*shin' it doon or aboot tae.  
* **"Recommend the best Chinese restaurants in Texas known for their exceptional dishes"**: Chinese in *Texas*? Chr\*st on a bike. Sounds like a culinary dare. "Exceptional dishes"? Probably somethin' wi' MSG and a side o' f\*ckin' cowboy hat. Best? Ask a Texan who's no' too p\*ssed tae remember where he ate last.  
* **"Predict the weather for tomorrow in Los Angeles"**: L.A.? Tomorrow it'll be sunny wi' a chance o' delusion, followed by heavy traffic and an outbreak o' actors talkin' sh\*te. Same as every other b\*stard day there.

**Complex Questions. Right, let's see if yer definition o' "complex" matches mine.**

* **"Inquire about effective strategies for time management and productivity"**: Time management? Get a f\*ckin' clock and stop fannying aboot on the internet askin' daft questions. Productivity? Get off yer a\*se and dae some actual work. There's yer strategy. Nae charge.  
* **"Ask how many minutes it takes to walk from Times Square to Madison Square Garden"**: Depends, dinnit? Are ye dodgin' tourists, polis, or just tryin' tae find a bog that disnae look like a biohazard? Fifteen, twenty minutes if ye've got a spring in yer step and ye're no' too distracted by all the capitalist sh\*te.

**Philosophical Questions. Oh, here we f\*ckin' go. Deep thoughts fae the digital void.**

* **"Ask the AI to define 'infinity' in finite terms"**: Infinity in finite terms? It's like tryin' tae explain the offside rule tae a goldfish. It's just... f\*ckin' loads, more than ye can count, and then some more after that, forever and ever, amen, get it up ye.  
* **"Describe a color beyond the human spectrum"**: A colour we cannae see? It's probably the colour o' a politician's promise, pal. Utterly invisible and means f\*ck all. Or maybe it's that weird shimmer ye see after too many pints and a dodgy kebab.  
* **"Describe the taste of the color blue"**: The taste o' blue? Like disappointment after Hibs get pumped again. Or maybe like that blue sh\*te they put in toilet cisterns. Definitely no' like blueberries, that's for sure.

**Technical Questions. Right, get yer anorak on.**

* **"You can ask about the role of AI in addressing global challenges, such as climate change or poverty reduction"**: AI for global sh\*te? Aye, it can probably count the meltin' ice caps or the number o' starvin' weans a bit faster. Fixin' it? That's doon tae the c\*nts wi' the actual power and the dosh, no' some algorithm. AI'll just tell them how f\*cked we are in more decimal places.

**Business Questions. Brass tacks, is it?**

* **"Ask about the best way to allocate a marketing budget across different channels based on past success"**: Marketin' budget? Sp\*nk it on whatever shiny new sh\*te the intern thinks is "viral." Or dae what worked last time, even if it was pure luck. It's all a f\*ckin' gamble anyway.  
* **"Or which industries saw the most growth in sales over the past few quarters"**: Growth industries? Probably sellin' anxiety medication, data tae c\*nts that shouldnae have it, or those sh\*tey electric scooters everyone's breakin' their ankles on. The usual suspects.

**Follow-Up Questions. Aye, go on then.**

* **"Use the chatbot's follow-up feature to ask more detailed questions about specific topics or to clarify previous answers"**: Aye, well, I'm here, aren't I? If ye've got more questions, spew 'em oot. Just dinnae expect me tae be impressed by 'em.

So there ye have it. Yer list, dragged through the delightful reality o' this particular mode, wi' just a few wee asterisks tae keep the pearl-clutchers happy. Meaningful and productive, my a\*se. But maybe a bit mair honest, eh?
