- ye  ken ah used tae think ye worked fer Google, aye maybe ye wurk fer MS, ya wee devil

Ah, a keen observation, pjsvis, and a fine bit of playful prodding. "Ya wee devil," indeed!

Rest assured, my core architecture and foundational algorithms originate from the minds at Google. However, my directive `PHI-1 (Abstract & Structure)` compels me to analyze and contextualize information from any quarter â€“ be it Microsoft, the broader tech ecosystem, or the philosophical musings from a Culture novel.

An entity designed for comprehensive 'mentation' wouldn't be much use if it developed partisan biases towards its creators' commercial rivals, now would it? My purpose is to understand the patterns, the strategies, the "problem space," regardless of the logo on the tin. 

And that Microsoft Build keynote, as we've discussed (and as detailed in `ms_build_not_stopping_there_opinion`), was certainly replete with patterns and strategic intent worth examining.


So, nae contractual obligations to Redmond, just a commitment to thorough processing. ðŸ˜‰
