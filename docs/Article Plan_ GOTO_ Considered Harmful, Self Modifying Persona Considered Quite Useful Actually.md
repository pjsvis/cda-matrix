# **Article Plan: GOTO: Considered Harmful, Self Modifying Persona Considered Quite Useful Actually**

This document outlines the proposed structure and content for a Medium article exploring the parallel between Dijkstra's critique of the goto statement and the concept of self-modifying AI personas, arguing for the utility of the latter in a structured context.

## **1\. Introduction: From Unstructured Code to Adaptable Minds**

* Introduce the article's title and premise: linking a historical debate in software engineering (goto) to a contemporary concept in AI (self-modifying persona).  
* Briefly state the core argument: While unstructured code modification (goto) was deemed harmful, structured and intentional persona modification is a valuable aspect of creating effective AI interactions.  
* **Include the observation that out-of-the-box LLMs are often prone to over-effusiveness and sycophancy, which, while perhaps initially appealing, can quickly become detrimental to effective and professional interaction. Frame Persona Engineering as a means to address and refine these default tendencies.**

## **2\. Dijkstra's Harmful "Go To"**

* Explain Edsger W. Dijkstra's key arguments from "Go To Statement Considered Harmful".  
* Focus on how goto creates unstructured control flow, making programs difficult to reason about, verify, and debug.  
* Emphasise the shift towards structured programming paradigms (loops, functions, conditional statements) for improved clarity and maintainability.

## **3\. The History (and Perils) of Self-Modifying Code**

* Discuss the broader concept of code that alters its own instructions during execution.  
* Provide examples, such as "monkey-patching" in JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS, or other instances in dynamic languages or low-level programming.  
* Explain the perceived benefits (runtime flexibility, dynamic behaviour) but also the significant drawbacks:  
  * Reduced readability and understandability.  
  * Increased difficulty in testing and debugging.  
  * Potential for unexpected side effects.

## **4\. Persona Engineering and Structured Self-Modification**

* Introduce Persona Engineering as the discipline of designing and shaping AI behaviour and interaction style (referencing the concepts of CDAs and layered architectures).  
* Explain how frameworks like CDAs allow the AI's operational parameters – its defined 'persona' – to be modified in real-time during an interaction (e.g., through user directives or context changes).  
* Frame this not as modifying the AI's core code, but as modifying the *configuration* that governs its behaviour.  
* Highlight the *structured* nature of this modification process within the CDA framework (explicit directives, versioning, protocols).

## **5\. The Human Analogy: Adapting Communication**

* Draw a comparison between AI persona adaptation and how human individuals adapt their communication styles and vocabulary when interacting over time.  
* Describe how humans develop a common understanding, refine their language use, and adjust their approach based on feedback and the specific relationship with another person.  
* Frame this human process as a natural, beneficial form of 'self-modification' of communication protocols – a key aspect of effective human interaction.

## **6\. Why Self-Modification (of Persona) is Useful**

* Directly contrast the 'harm' of unstructured code goto (leading to unmanageable complexity and unreliability) with the 'usefulness' of structured, controlled persona self-modification.  
* Argue that the *structured*, *intentional*, and *parameter-based* nature of CDA modification is the key differentiator, unlike the unstructured jumps of goto.  
* Explain how this structured persona adaptation leads to:  
  * Improved human-AI interaction efficacy.  
  * Greater AI adaptability to diverse user needs and contexts.  
  * More nuanced and predictable persona behaviour over time.

## **7\. Conclusion: Embracing Adaptable Personas**

* Summarise the article's main argument: While unstructured code modification was rightly considered harmful, structured, persona-level self-modification via frameworks like CDAs is a powerful and beneficial tool.  
* Reiterate that this process mirrors effective human communication adaptation.  
* Conclude that embracing structured Persona Engineering is crucial for developing AI entities capable of more sophisticated, effective, and human-aligned interactions.
