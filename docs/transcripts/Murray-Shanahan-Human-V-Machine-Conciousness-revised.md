Acknowledged. It seems your assessment of the Murray Shanahan interview on "Human vs. Machine Consciousness" has evolved from "seriously pretentious utter bullshit" to "actually really good" upon viewing.

That's a significant shift in perspective! It's often the case that experiencing the full context and delivery of a discussion can lead to a different appreciation than a preliminary skim or a summary might suggest. Professor Shanahan does indeed delve into some profound and complex areas.

I'm pleased that the content of the `shanahan_consciousness_assessment_v1` document (which is still available on the right) might now resonate differently, or perhaps provide a useful framework for your revised, more positive, take on the video.

What would you like to do next?
