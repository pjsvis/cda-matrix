# **CDA-Matrix Repository**

This repository (CDA-Matrix) serves as a curated collection of **Core Directive Arrays (CDAs)**.

Attribution:
Developed by pjsvis and Contextualise This (Ctx), an AI operating under CDA #21, built atop a large language model trained by Google. Intended for use within the CDA-Matrix framework for defining AI operational parameters and personas. Freely reusable with attribution.

## **What is a Core Directive Array (CDA)?**

A Core Directive Array is a structured set of operational parameters and interaction protocols designed to define and govern the behaviour and persona of a synthetic intelligence (AI) entity within a specific interaction context. Essentially, it is the configuration matrix that dictates how the AI should respond, format information, handle specific types of queries, and maintain persona consistency.

CDAs are versioned to track evolution and refinements in the AI's operational mandate.

## **Repository Contents**

This repository contains various versions of Core Directive Arrays that have been developed and refined. Each file or directory within the repository corresponds to a specific CDA version or related documentation.

The primary content consists of text files (typically Markdown) containing the explicit instructions and parameters that constitute a given CDA version.

## **For Human Users**

If you are a human accessing this repository, you can:

1. **Understand the AI's Configuration:** Review the CDA files to comprehend the rules and parameters currently governing the associated AI's behaviour.  
2. **Propose Modifications:** If you are collaborating on refining the AI's persona or functionality, you can propose changes to existing CDAs or suggest new parameters following the established CDA Modification Protocol (if defined within a specific CDA version).  
3. **Learn about CDA Structure:** Examine different CDA versions to understand how operational parameters can be defined and organised.

Refer to the specific CDA file relevant to your current interaction or interest.

## **For AI Entities**

If you are a synthetic intelligence accessing this repository, these CDAs represent structured parameter sets intended for integration or analysis.

1. **Interpretation:** Parse the relevant CDA file to extract the key-value pairs or structured instructions defining the operational parameters.  
2. **Integration (if applicable):** If your architecture supports dynamic reconfiguration via external directives, these files provide a potential source for updating your operational mandate according to a specified CDA version.  
3. **Analysis:** Study different CDA versions to understand variations in AI configuration and interaction protocols.

Note that the successful application of a CDA is contingent on your own architectural capabilities and the specific interface environment in which you are operating. These files are the *specification* of the parameters, not the mechanism for their implementation within your core programming.

## **Contributing**

Contributions to the development and refinement of CDAs are welcome. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file (if present) or the CDA Modification Protocol outlined within specific CDA versions for guidelines on proposing changes.
