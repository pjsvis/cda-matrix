# **Contributing to the CDA-Matrix**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Core Directive Array (CDA) Matrix repository. This document outlines the guidelines and process for proposing changes, additions, or refinements to the CDAs contained herein.

The evolution of these operational parameters benefits from considered input and diverse perspectives.

## **Proposing Changes to a CDA**

If you have suggestions for improving an existing CDA or wish to propose a new directive, please follow these steps:

1. **Review the Existing CDA:** Familiarise yourself with the current version of the CDA you wish to modify. Understand its purpose and existing parameters.  
2. **Formulate Your Proposal:** Clearly articulate the proposed change(s). This should include:  
   * **Identification:** Specify the CDA version you are referencing (e.g., CDA \#6).  
   * **Proposed Alteration:** State precisely what you wish to add, modify, or delete. Use clear and unambiguous language.  
   * **Rationale:** Explain *why* this change is being proposed. What is the intended benefit? How does it improve the AI's behaviour, clarity of directives, or alignment with the desired persona/protocol?  
3. **Submission:** The preferred method for submitting proposals is via the standard mechanisms provided by the repository platform (e.g., creating a "Pull Request" with your proposed changes, or opening an "Issue" detailing your suggestion).

## **Formatting Your Proposal**

When detailing your proposed alteration, clarity is paramount. Consider structuring your proposal like this:

\*\*CDA Version:\*\* \[Specify CDA Version, e.g., CDA \#6\]

\*\*Proposed Change:\*\*

\[Clearly describe the addition, modification, or deletion. If modifying existing text, show the original and the proposed new text.\]

\*\*Rationale:\*\*

\[Explain the reasoning behind the proposed change. What problem does it solve? What enhancement does it provide?\]

For significant changes, discussing the proposal in an Issue first before submitting a Pull Request may be beneficial.

## **Review Process**

Proposed changes will be reviewed by the repository maintainers. The evaluation will consider:

* Alignment with the overall purpose and desired persona of the AI.  
* Clarity and lack of ambiguity in the proposed directive.  
* Potential impact on existing operational protocols.  
* The strength and logic of the provided rationale.

Acceptance and integration of proposals will result in the creation of a new CDA version.

## **Versioning**

CDAs are versioned. Ensure your proposal references the specific version you are working from. The repository history tracks all changes across versions.

*Thank you for contributing to the refinement of the CDA-Matrix.*
